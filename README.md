A hacked together simplified version of ProtectionStones to allow players to create their very first region with a protectionstone and let server staff take care for everything else what ever may come. 'cause stone cold said so.

Commands may be broken, did not test. Most are unneeded anyways

If a player gets a new protection stone and sets it the existing region will be moved to the new location. However if the region has been resized earlier the moved region will have the default size again.


Watch out for the "eye".
